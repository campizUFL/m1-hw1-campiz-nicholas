## About Me ##
Hello, world. I am Nicholas Campiz. I currently live in Tallahasse, Florida, and am a native of North Florida, having also lived in Jacksonville and Gainesville. I am a cartographer and geographer by trade and currently do mapping and data visualization for the FL Department of Transportation. I have also worked abroad for international organizations, most recently in Ukrane, doing information management and tech project implementation and management for them. I have a B.S. in Geography and M.A. in International Business with the University of Florida. I enjoy travel, craft beer, and floating in the Florida springs.
## Past Coding Experience ##
I have had an off and off relationship with coding, mostly focused on Python, which is the main coding language for Geographic Information Systems. I unfortunately have not progressed past the basics, with other members of team handling the programming better. I wish to learn though. I have a little more experience with HTML and CSS for coding websites.
## Career Goals ##
1. Improve and modernize my coding and technical skills.
2. Return to working for international and non-governmental organizations and assisting in mapping, data visualization, and information management project implemenation and management. 
3. Head back to Ukraine.
4. Mentor younger cartographers and mappers.
